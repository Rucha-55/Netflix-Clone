# Netflix-Clone
This project is a front-end clone of the Netflix homepage, created using HTML and CSS. The design closely mimics the user interface of Netflix, showcasing features such as a responsive header, a multi-section layout with various feature highlights, and a footer with navigation links. The clone aims to provide a similar visual experience to the actual Netflix homepage.
